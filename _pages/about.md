Hello everyone, I am Piyush Tiwari. I am currently working as Project Scientist in Virtual Reality Lab at IIT Delhi under [Prof Rahul Narain](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/) and [Prof Subodh Kumar](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~subodh/). Here I work on real time and interactive simulation and rendering of Neurosurgery operation called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy(ETV) Surgery. This project is funded by Department of Science and Technology, India, in collaboration with AIIMS Delhi.

Previous to this I was Research Assitant at Indian Institute of Science(IISC) Bangalore. I worked at [Vision and AI Lab(VAL)](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html) under [Prof Venkatesh Babu](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/). My work was based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, especially with GANs. We used StyleGan's latent space decompostion for motion disentaglement in a video.

I also have 2 years of industry experience as Computer Vision Research Engineer at [LensCorp.ai](https://lenscorp.ai/) and [Spyne.ai](https://www.spyne.ai/). My work was based on working with Deep Neural Networks to solve complex Computer Vision problems. Few of Projects I worked on includes Image Background removal, Image Super Resolution, 3D mesh generation, and Image Processing.
