Hello everyone, I am Muhammad Usman Afzal. I am currently on Project Erasmus in Universidad di Zarragozza and a full time student in University di Bologna. This project is funded by Mobilita di Europa Union.

Previous to this I was Research Assitant at Infromation Technology University(ITU) Punjab. I worked at [CISS Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cissglobal/posts/?feedView=all) under currently [Principal Investigator Dr Alaa Awad Abdelatif, Dr.Shahzad Ahmad and Dr.Ammar Rafique](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaa-awad-abdellatif-63526591). My work was based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, especially with UAVs. We exploited Energy Efficient Communication Techniques in unmanned aerial vehicle scenario.

I also have 2 years of part time industry experience as Integrator and Research Engineer at [DAT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dat-fzco/posts/?feedView=all). My work was based on working with Antenna Pattern Generation and Recognition to solve complex Wave Vision problems and we used Deep Neural Networks to train datasets of MIMO devices. Few of Projects I worked on includes Image Background removal, Image Super Resolution, 3D mesh generation, and Image Processing.
