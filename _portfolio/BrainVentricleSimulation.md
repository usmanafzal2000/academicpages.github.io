We are recreating the ETV Surgery using graphical rendering of anatomical models of the brain’s ventricle. To perform the surgery, we are utilizing a tearing algorithm to make cuts on the membrane. This procedure is facilitated by the SOFA Framework which incorporates the use of a Virtuose Haption6D haptic device. The membrane structure is modeled and shaded based on observations from surgery videos. We used tearing algorithm through sofa plugin that performs realistic tearing through collision of haption device and thin membrane.
